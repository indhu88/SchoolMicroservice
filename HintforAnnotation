@Builder - to create buiilder class for particular class to create oblect in ease, reducae the boilerplate code, enchance the readbility of java code

ex:
@Builder
public class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  private String address;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person person = Person.builder()
      .name("John Doe")
      .age(30)
      .address("123 Main Street")
      .build();

    System.out.println(person);
  }
}
@Builder
@Value
public class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  private String address;
}


@Value annotation is used to make class as immutable. once person object is created cant able to change the value of fields.
